Create a responsive, browser-based flashcard application using JavaScript. You may use frameworks but the solution should run directly in the browser without requiring a build/compile step. The app should have an intuitive interface with clean design.

Deck Management
- Allow users to upload flashcard decks via CSV files with the following format:
  - Required columns: `question`, `answer`
  - Optional columns: `image_url`, `category`
- Provide a library view that displays all uploaded decks with:
  - Deck name (derived from CSV filename)
  - Card count
- Support local storage to persist decks between sessions
- Allow users to delete or rename decks

Study Interface
- When a user selects a deck, provide study configuration options:
  - Random/sequential card order toggle
  - Number of cards to study (all or specific number)
  - Time limit per card (optional)
  - Category to choose (optional)
- Implement a clean card flipping animation when revealing answers
- Display progress (cards completed/total)
- Include navigation controls (previous/next card/auto play)

Study Features
- Track statistics for each card (times viewed, correct/incorrect responses)
- Allow users to mark cards as "easy" or "difficult" for targeted practice
- Support keyboard shortcuts for common actions (flip card, mark correct/incorrect)
- Include a hint system for difficult cards (optional)

Visual Design
- Use responsive design for mobile and desktop usage
- Implement a light/dark mode toggle
- Display images appropriately when available
- Ensure adequate text contrast and readability for all cards

Export/Import
- Support merging of decks
- Provide sample CSV templates for users to download

Technical Requirements
- Ensure the app functions without internet connection after initial load
- Handle errors gracefully (invalid CSV format, missing data)
- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
- Include proper accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Add basic data validation for CSV imports
